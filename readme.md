# Installation

## Prerquisites

* Git
* Ruby 1.9.3


## Installation

Clone the repository using

    git clone git@github.com:jcfischer/payment_protocol.git

Enter the directory and install the bundler gem

    gem install bundler

If you receive an error at this point, Ruby is not installed correctly. When bundler is installed, you can install
the dependencies of the OIPP:

    bundle install



## Testing the protocol server

Open two command line shells. Start the protocol server in one:

    $ ruby init.rb


### REQUEST Phase

In the other, issue the following commands (playing the merchant, that requests a new transaction to take place)

    echo '{"transaction":{"amount":10.5,"currency":"EUR","reference_number":"ref_1234","merchant_id":1234,"signature":"ac72e03ccb6ff1b5d203784f9313e38e","uuid":"6bab2c5c-62b8-5d02-c891-f163375635bb"}}' | curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- http://localhost:4567/tokens

You should receive the following response:

    {"token":51024,"transaction_id":"c7501f73b0e7dfcb1495d7c60829f447"}

If you issue the request a second time, you will get an error message:

    {"error":"Request already seen by server"}

### AUTHORIZE Phase

To confirm the transaction, issue the following command (now playing the customer):

    echo '{"customer_id": 1}' | curl -X PUT -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @- http://localhost:4567/authorisation/c7501f73b0e7dfcb1495d7c60829f447

You should see the servers confirmation:

    {"status":"authorized","transaction_id":"c7501f73b0e7dfcb1495d7c60829f447"}

If you try to redo the authorizsation, you will see the following error:

    {"error":"Transaction was already authorized","transaction_id":"c7501f73b0e7dfcb1495d7c60829f447"}


If you try to authorize the transaction with customer_id = 2, you will receive the following error:

    {"error":"Transaction not authorized by server","transaction_id":"c7501f73b0e7dfcb1495d7c60829f447"}

### NOTIFICATION Phase

Finally, in terminal 1, you will see the dummy notification that would be sent to the merchant:

    Calling Merchant with the following data
    {:amount=>10.5, :currency=>"EUR", :merchant_id=>1234, :status=>:authorized, :transaction_id=>"c7501f73b0e7dfcb1495d7c60829f447", :token=>51024, :reference_number=>"ref_1234", :uuid=>"016bdf50-feb3-012e-0751-60f84734f770"}
